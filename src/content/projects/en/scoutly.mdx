After learning Rust for a while, I wanted to build a project that could take advantage of its performance and safety features. Also I want to practice my Rust skills. I decided to create Scoutly, a fast and lightweight CLI website crawler and SEO analyzer. It's inspired by [Scrutiny](https://peacockmedia.software/mac/scrutiny/).
